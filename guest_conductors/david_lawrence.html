        David Lawrence is one of Britain's most versatile young conductors. He studied choral conducting with Simon Halsey and orchestral conducting with Colin Metters and George Hurst at the Royal Academy of Music, where he won all the major conducting prizes. His present posts include those of Artistic Director of the Ulster Youth Choir, Choir Leader of the City of Birmingham Young Voices, Assistant Conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Chorus, and he is a regular guest chorusmaster with the Netherlands Radio Choir. He has also directed the Training Choir of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and the Cambridgeshire County Youth Choir.
       </p><p>
        David maintains a special interest in contemporary music and in November 2002, having prepared the first performance with James Wood, conducted the German première of Karlheinz Stockhausen's Engel Prozessionen, Scene II from the opera Sonntag aus Licht, with the Netherlands Radio Choir. Over the Summer of 2003 he worked with the New London Chamber Choir on premières of music by James Wood and Iannis Xenakis for the BBC Proms season, and in November of that year was invited to conduct the New London Chamber Choir in a programme based around the music of Benjamin Britten. He has also prepared and conducted world premières both of choral works and operas by composers including Graham Fitkin, Stanley Glasser, Cornelius de Bondt, Bob Chilcott, and Andrew Gant.
    </p><p>
        As an orchestral conductor David continues to work with ViVA (East of England Orchestra), the Hanover Band and the Helix Ensemble, a contemporary music group based in the Midlands. Operatic productions have included Le Nozze di Figaro, and La Cenerentola for Heart of England Opera. He has represented Great Britain at an International Festival of Music and Dance in Bangalore, India, and for three years travelled to Colombia as a guest conductor. In 2003 he made his first trip to Canada, and he has conducted in Poland, Hungary, the Slovak Republic, Switzerland, France, Holland, and Germany.
    </p><p>
        David is a popular workshop leader with Britain's choirs and leading choral organisations such as youngchoirs.net (formerly BFYC), Making Music (NFMS), Sing for Pleasure, and the Association of British Choral Directors.  As a conducting teacher he directs courses for, amongst others, the Voices Foundation and Canford International Summer School of Music. He is a respected adjudicator of festivals and competitions, and a National Adjudicator for the televised BBC Radio 3 Choir of the Year competition. He conducts for BBC Television's Songs of Praise, and is frequently in demand as a consultant in choral education.
    </p><p>
        David holds the Guinness Record for conducting the largest choir in the UK (6,846 young people in one of the annual series of Young World Concerts), and later this year will conduct CBYV for the Royal Family at a special concert in the Ballroom of Buckingham Palace.  Plans for 2005 also include an Australian workshop tour, and the preparation of new works by Per Nørgård, James Wood and Pierre Boulez.
