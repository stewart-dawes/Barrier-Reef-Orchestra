            <input onclick="return toggleMe('hidden_para2')" type="button" value="+ Review – AFCM 25th Anniversary Concert" /><br>
            <span ID="hidden_para2" style="display: none">
                <p>A very pleasant Sunday afternoon in Queens Gardens was attended by approximately three and half thousand satisfied music lovers. This free concert organised to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the AFCM was also a fitting opportunity for BRO to celebrate its 15th Anniversary with it’s first ever outdoor public performance.
                </p><p>
                The tastes of all music lovers was satiated. The concert opened with the ceremonial and pompous Brass composition by Aaron Copland titled Fanfare for the Common Man, followed by the equally ceremonial Imperial March by William Walton. Genuine fun and musical camaraderie emanated from the performance by Camerata of St Johns with their virtuosic classical performance. In addition they ably accompanied Amy Dickson in her flawless saxophone performance with her distinctive tone clearly displaying the reason she is sought after around the world.
                </p><p>
                1RAR Big Band played to the high standard Townsville audiences are familiar. They had the audience tapping their feet to their musical and vocal compositions. Cheryl Barker’s powerful soprano rang across the park and most likely was heard on Castle Hill as she sang two arias accompanied by BRO and conducted by UK conductor Nicholas Daniel.
                </p><p>
                The finale of the afternoon which included musicians from all three ensembles was the 1812 Overture. It was delightful to see the audience enthusiastically participate in this finale. This pleasant afternoon can only be rated as a huge success and may prove to be the first of many performances in years to come.</p>
            </span><hr>


            <input onclick="return toggleMe('hidden_para3')" type="button" value="+ Review – Dreams and Dances" /><br>
            <span ID="hidden_para3" style="display: none">
                    <p>Dance and music go together like a, ahem, horse and carriage or in 2016 a iPhone and thumb! But unlike the old song you certainly can have one without the other and the Barrier Reef Orchestra’s first concert for the year Dreams and Dances definitely proved that. The first half of the program featured dance music in its many variations.
                </p><p>The program, selected by our Conductor of long standing Richard McIntyre, opened with the exciting and exotic “Bacchanale” from St. Saens’ opera Samson and Delilah – compelling from the onset, with Bernard Girard’s evocative oboe solo. Rhythmic drive was strong and the string section made a fine job of the glorious central “Love” theme. You wouldn’t have been surprised if seven of the women player’s silk scarves floated up to perform a sinuous dance above the Orchestra.
                </p><p>A Pavane is a majestic processional dance and Gabriel Faure’s rather haunting version featured fine ensemble and character from the woodwind section and excellent melodic contributions from the strings. Debussy’s dreaming Faun inspired some beautiful, intricate and delicate music. Solo contributions from Shinako Macdonald on Flute and Lea Li on the Harp reinforced our previous discovery on how well these two instruments complement each other.
                </p><p>Danzon No 2 by Mexican composer Arturo Marquez provided and exhilarating conclusion to the first half of the concert with ever increasing pace and intensity. Excellent solo contributions from trumpeter Arthur Florence, Clarinetist Jacinta Payne, pianist Stephanie Rigano and many others made the music a pleasure for the audience, what’s more the whole Orchestra looked as if they were enjoying themselves immensely.
                </p><p>After interval we were treated to a Symphony written by Cesar Frank and finished in 1888. This Symphony in D Minor had clear repeating themes and although considered a difficult piece the Orchestra conveyed the full joyousness of it to an appreciative audience, especially at the end. Overall this was another highly accomplished concert; the program had a mixture of familiar and not so familiar-but-should-be pieces which was just perfect. It is great to hear favourite pieces live and to learn new favourites. The Orchestra is well balanced, highly professional and well-polished and musicians seem to enjoy playing as much as the audience enjoys listening to them. The music notes by Dr David Salisbury were informative and helped the understanding of what was being played.
                </p><p>I know many people agree with me that this has been the best concert yet. Bravo all who made it happen.</p>

            <input onclick="return toggleMe('hidden_para4')" type="button" value="+ Review – World Music Concert" /><br>
            <span ID="hidden_para4" style="display: none">
                    <p>The World Music Concert was a breath of fresh air to Townsville music lovers who had just about reached classical music saturation following AFCM.
                </p><p>Andrew Ryder poured his expertise and enthusiasm into this opportunity provided through Townsville City Council sponsorship. Andrew developed the concept for the concert; sourced the music which involved him personally arranging some of the music; liaising with the professional performers; and rehearsing and conducting the Barrier Reef Orchestra.
                </p><p>The performance delighted more than one sense through the visual backdrop showing scenery pertinent to the music and the amazing musical sound evoking toe tapping, clapping, singing and sheer enjoyment.
                </p><p>The world tour began with David Hudson on didgeridoo, guitar and vocals synchronizing with the visual backdrop to grab the audiences’ attention, performing the popular John Williamson ballad Raining on the Rock. The tour continued through Korea and Cuba courtesy of a quality Barrier Reef Orchestral performance. Next, virtuosic Domenico Taraborrelli on piano accordion and vocalist Adam Lopez, supported by the Orchestra, engaged the audience with Latin American pieces. Unfortunately the balance was a little off, with the soloists being much louder.
                </p><p>The second half began with the Barrier Reef Orchestra creating an American theme through Aaron Copland before heading off to Europe with the Orchestra supporting Domenico once again in Italy, John Ferguson on bagpipes with vocalist Cynthia Clark in Scotland and Adam Lopez in Spain.
                </p><p>The tour aptly returned to Australia with all the soloists returning to the stage to present a rousing and emotive performance of I am Australian.
            </p><p>This very enjoyable performance once again demonstrated the talented people choosing to live in Townsville and able to produce such a high class production, equal to anywhere. This was reinforced by the willingness of quality professional musicians to come to Townsville and perform with the Barrier Reef Orchestra. I feel certain if more was known about the concert the Civic Theatre would easily have been at capacity.</p>

            <input onclick="return toggleMe('hidden_para5')" type="button" value="+ President’s Report – 2016" /><br>
            <span ID="hidden_para5" style="display: none">
        <p>2015 was our 15 year anniversary and featured several concerts that highlighted not only the enhanced quality of musical performance from the orchestra but an increasing recognition from our audience, benefactors and the wider community.
                </p><p>In May BRO was asked to perform at the Townsville ARTS Awards, a first for the orchestra, with a selection from Frozen, not your standard repertoire but well received by the audience and an indication that the orchestra can is and capable of taking on a diverse range of music. This was to be a feature in the last 12 months.
                </p><p>August was another first for BRO as were invited to perform at a free public concert as part of the Australian Festival of Chamber Music. Supported by Townsville City Council and featuring other ensembles such as 1RAR band and Camerata of St. John’s string ensemble. The performance culminated in Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture Op.49 with a twist. Involving the audience simulating the cannons with paper bags and car keys…. you had to be there. The audience was in excess of 4000 and proved very popular. So much so we have been invited back for another performance in 2016. Thank you Justin.
                </p><p>As is often the case rehearsals for the World Music Concert were well under way prior to the AFCM concert. World Music Concert offered a music tour of the world featuring Adam Lopez (Vocalist), Domenico Tarraborrelli on Accordion and David Hudson on digeridoo, vocals and guitar. Audio/Visual was used throughout the concert and several of the arrangements were specifically written for the performance. As it involved 21 pieces of music and extra musicians for 1RAR and further afield. Sally our Orchestra Manager had her work cut out for her and I am pleased to say rose to the challenge. I had the privilege to produce direct and conduct the performance. After the performance which was well received by the audience, given the letters and feedback we received, we had a big exhale at completing such a mammoth task.
                </p><p>This concert was hired in by Townsville Civic Theatre, another first for BRO. As was our next performance which was a collaboration with Dancenorth in their presentation of a unique work titled Twilight written and directed by Ng Chor Guan an international artist and located on the headlands of Kissing Point. It involved elements of BRO Brass section performing music in response to the environment. With no music written it was up the musicians to play given limited guidelines; certainly a challenge for those of us who are used to using written music. From all reports it was particularly effective.
                </p><p>Rounding out the year was A Musical Feast in November conducted by Mark Shiell. Mark commented that he thought the orchestra and improved musically since he last worked with the BRO, pleasing feedback from a professional. A potpourri of music that was enjoyed by all.
                </p><p>2016 was soon upon us commencing with the launch at the Pier restaurant with a performance from the Strings and a last minute addition of soprano Siobhan Patrick, a spell binding performance that I think will lead to further collaborations with her. The launch also allowed me to reinforce our Commitment to TPAC (www.tpac.net.au) while we had the Mayor’s full attention. This continues to be an ongoing concern that requires all of us to push TPAC forward at every opportunity.
                </p><p>Plunging head-long into rehearsals for Dreams and Dances conducted by Richard McIntyre. Ric once again come up with an interesting program the highlight being the Marquez, full of Latin rhythms and percussion. A piece I hope we get to perform again soon.
                </p><p>Finally it brings us to our performance in the Townsville 150 concert centre piece for the T150 celebrations. Once again by invitation from Townsville Civic Theatre in collaboration with 1RAR, we provided music for all of the artists and were on stage for the whole performance. A hugely successful event due in large to BRO.
                </p><p>Conducted by the new Major Domino of 1RAR band the stage was filled with over 60 musicians. David Campbell who was the headline act commented at his one and only rehearsal that the assembled ensemble was first class and would come back to Townsville any time as he was thrilled to have such a fine orchestra to sing with. It was a full house and the BRO received many accolades as a result of playing too many in the audience that had not previously heard BRO.
                </p><p>We initially set a program of three performances and completed eight in the last 12 months. To make all this happen you need an Orchestra Manager that is tireless in her commitment and ready to make it all happen We are so fortunate to have Sally as our Orchestra Manager. Many thanks Sally, words are not enough to reward you for all of the extra work that you give us.
                </p><p>The engine room that keeps everything heading in the right direction is our indomitable committee. As I won’t be standing this year as President, it brings my two year reign of terror to an end. I thank you all for your support and hard work that you all put in to make this happen for the musicians and the audience. Again words are not enough.
                </p><p>I must draw your attention to our Treasurer, Annette who has so capably steered the financial ship for several years. Your professionalism could always be relied upon and your advice was always on the money pardon the pun. As you are stepping down please accept my thanks on behalf of the BRO for all of your hard work. I note that the Sturt Business Centre will be continuing their support to BRO so I know we will still have close contact with you. For those that have an interest in joining the BRO committee I can assure you, you will find it challenging, stimulating and a group of people on the committee who stand ready to help.
            </p><p>Thank You</p>

            <input onclick="return toggleMe('hidden_para6')" type="button" value="+ Review – T150 Concert" /><br>
            <span ID="hidden_para6" style="display: none">
                    <p>Those among us in the capacity audience in the Civic theatre to celebrate Townsville’s 150th anniversary had a real treat of a birthday present. The Variety concert would have had about 97% Townsville connected content and showcased what talent is in Townsville.
                </p><p>Ex Kirwan boy Kurt Phelan was a charming host and made some great 20thC songs his own with some interesting arrangements. Like-wise for Luke Kennedy who also sang one of his own compositions and different rendering of now classic songs. David Campbell also gave us perfect covers of, amongst others, Bobby Darin and Sammy Davis Jr. works.
                </p><p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra showed its versatility yet again. It accompanied the singers perfectly and shone in its own right with Brahms Hungarian Dance No. 5. The 1RAR Band was also superb and in its element when backing Jade, Kurt, Luke and David. Conductor Maj. Glenn Rogers was at the centre of it all, effortlessly conducting the diverse variety of music presented. I’m told “Glenn’s calm approach during rehearsals came to the fore during the one and only rehearsal with David Campbell. Glenn quickly picked the changes David asked for which translated to a freshness during the performance. Glenn is also a remarkable arranger and produced an orchestral arrangement of one of Kurt’s original songs. So moving was the music it brought tears to Kurts eyes as he sang it with the Orchestra”. Both the Orchestra and the 1RAR Band were on the stage the whole evening, only getting a break when the two dance companies were performing.
                </p><p>But even with such a high standard set it was the ladies who were the sensation of the evening. Greta Sheriff was spot on – she had the poise, the looks, the moves and a fantastic vocal range. Jade O’Halloran was all sultriness and emotion in Skyfall and Bronwyn Douglass, the mezzo soprano who won 2015 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition vocal section, showed us why she is winning yet more awards. As part of Bronwyn’s prize she was to sing with the Orchestra but unfortunately all the Orchestra’s dates at the theatre (pre-booked 2 years ago) were unsuitable for Bronwyn as she is very much in demand. We were very fortunate that the Variety Concert provided the Orchestra an opportunity to perform two of the best known arias in opera with her – Habanera from Carmen and Mon Coeur from Samson and Delilah. Too little I know but every second was wonderful and we are grateful for that.
                </p><p>Combined choir and soloists from Townsville Choral Society and North Queensland Opera and Music Theatre ensemble gave us excerpts from Les Miserables. What can be said except well done you again. It is these group’s high standards and professionalism that nurture young talent like Luke, Greta and Kurt and others (same as for the BRO who have had many young players go on to tertiary studies in music). The highlight of this section for me was Alex Thomas singing Bring Him Home but Soloists, Ensemble and Orchestra all combined to give us a memorable moment.
            </p><p>I have heard of some towns being “nests” which seem to produce multiple sports and artistic greats. This concert showed us Townsville can certainly be considered a “music nest” and can be proud of all its performing arts companies. Richard Florida in Rise of the Creative Class wrote that creating an environment that encourages artists, writers and geeks is an important engine for economic growth in the post industrial world. I feel that Townsville has a head start in this.</p>
