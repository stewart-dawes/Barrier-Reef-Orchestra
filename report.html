<h2>Testing Details</h2>
<p>The web site was tested using several web browers for style and functionality. It was noted that there were some issues in Firefox with styling, however the group agreed to concentrate on Explorer, Edge and Chrome.</p>

</ul>
<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong>All assigned tasks were completed on time and we had an agreement on the chosen design. Using Skype permitted a fast response time from group members, which made completing tasks and getting feedback very fast and allowed things to progress smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses:</strong>One of the biggest problems with completing the assessment was the fact that it was through distance education and that we never met up in person to design the website. While we did use skype to communicate (both voice and text) it is however still difficult to see someone elseâ€™s design ideas though words without the visual element.<br>
Additionally, Stewart had a large period of the assignment work time where he was not able to regularly contribute online, only completing work offline. It was decided by the group that Github could not be relied upon, favoring the sharing of files and part-files via skype.
</p>
<p><strong>Interesting</strong>: During the development process, we did not utilise GitHub. This is becasuse we decided as a group that using skype would be better suited for the majority of discussion/file sharing, as one person was doing the majority of the html/css. <br>
</p>
<p>Also interesting was the quality control aspect of the assignment. It took us a while to realise we were viewing in different browers, causing a difference of experience and qc.</p>
<p>An interesting (frustraiting) event was having skype changing transparent images to have a white background. This was overcome with a lot of trail and error......</p>
